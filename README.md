### Buyer Persona Analysis Project

## About Me
Hi, IÂ´m Nico FrÃ­as a professional transitioning to a career in business and data analytics. 
Currently working as a Project Manager for Tecnologico de Monterrey, and leading an project in digital transformation for internal documentation audits using Power Apps. 
This project has the purpose to show my learning journey and demonstration of my technical and analytical capabilities, but also demonstrating my capacity of adapting and learning new concepts. 

## Project Overview
This repository documents my journey into data analytics through with a real estate buyer persona analysis project. By analyzing sales data, the objective is to identify patterns among successful buyers and create detailed buyer personas that can match potential customers.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze real estate sales data to identify patterns and trends
- Develop data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines
- Apply multivariate analysis and clustering techniques to segment buyers
- Create detailed buyer personas based on statistical analysis
- Implement visualization tools to communicate insights effectively
- Build a complete data pipeline from raw data to actionable insights

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Python**: Data cleaning, analysis, and machine learning with pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **SQL**: Database design, data storage, and complex queries
- **R**: Statistical analysis and advanced visualization
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards with various tools
- **Machine Learning**: Clustering and predictive modeling
- **DevOps**: Containerization, API development, and deployment

## Current Progress
This project is being developed in multiple phases:
1. ðŸ”„ Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
2. â¬œ Enhanced pattern analysis for successful sales
3. â¬œ Clustering and buyer persona development
4. â¬œ Database integration and API development
5. â¬œ Interactive dashboards and reporting
6. â¬œ Deployment and automation

## Data Sources
The analysis uses anonymized real estate sales data with buyer information, focusing on successful sales to identify patterns that lead to purchases.

## Methodology
The project employs a comprehensive approach:
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning, validation, and feature engineering
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Understanding data distributions and relationships
3. **Clustering Analysis**: Identifying natural buyer segments
4. **Persona Development**: Creating detailed buyer profiles based on clusters
5. **Validation**: Testing personas against new data

## Learning Journey
This project represents my transition into business and data analytics, structured as a 16-week comprehensive learning program. Each phase builds upon previous knowledge, gradually incorporating more advanced techniques while maintaining focus on the central goal of buyer persona analysis.
